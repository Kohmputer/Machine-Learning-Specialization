# Notes on Machine Learning
These notes are information I found helpful while studying about Machine Learning through different coureses. They include high level overviews, practical tips, and lots of walkthroughs through core mathematical concepts.

What is Machine Learning? 
- Machine Learning is about using **statistical models to find patterns and make predictions**. 

The Machine Learning Process

- ML models are only as good as the data they are built on ("garbage in, garbage out")
- Data prep & QA happens behind the scences, but typically accounts for the majority (**80%+**) of the machine learning workflow

In a nutshell, the process can be summarized as following: 
1. **Quality Assurance (QA)** is about preparing & cleaning data prior to analysis.
2. **Univariate profiling** is about **exploring individual variables** to build an understanding of your data.
3. **Multivariate profiling** is about understanding relationships between multiple variables.
4. Machine learning is a natural extension of multivariate profiling, and uses statistical models and methods to answer questions which are too complex to solve using simple visual analysis or trial-and-error.
